        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Put the shallot, lime juice and a pinch of salt in a small bowl and use your fingers to gently massage everything together. Set aside to pickle lightly while you make the rest. Put all the dressing ingredients in another bowl and whisk to combine and dissolve the sugar. Add 2–4tsp water to loosen the mixture (this will vary according to the make of tamarind paste). Put 1tbsp oil in a large frying pan set over a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the garlic and cook for 90 seconds, stirring, until fragrant and lightly coloured, then stir in the spinach along with a couple pinches of salt and cook for around 4 minutes until wilted. Transfer to a serving plate and wipe out the pan. Add the remaining 21/2tbsp oil plus the turmeric to the same pan, stirring to combine, and return it to a medium-high heat. Once hot but not smoking, crack in the eggs and quickly sprinkle the whites with the chili slices. Season the eggs all over with a good pinch of salt and use a spatula to separate the whites so the eggs are not joined together. Fry for 3–4 minutes, spooning some of the oil over the whites. You want the whites to be crispy around the edges and the yolk to be runny, but you can fry them for longer if you prefer them more cooked. Use a spatula to transfer the eggs to the plate of spinach, drizzling over any extra turmeric oil from the pan. Top with the pickled shallots, then drizzle some tamarind dressing over, serving the remainder alongside.
