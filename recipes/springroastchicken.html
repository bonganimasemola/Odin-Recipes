        <h1>Spring Roast Chicken Recipe</h1>
        <p>I’m not the first to combine lemon, garlic and chicken – and I won’t be the last – but sometimes it’s good to be reminded that the classics are classics for a reason.

You can prep the chicken 4–5 hours in advance if you like, and then just place in the oven when ready to cook.</p>
